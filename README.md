# Steaks-Shakes-and-Student-Loans
Pay off your student debt!

This is a game from 2019. This was my first big project in Java and was the final project for the 2019 UCF Summer Camp.

This game is about working at a place that sells shakes and burgers (definitely not Steak and Shake) to attempt to pay of student loans.
Right now the loan is set at $10.
You earn money from getting orders correctly and you lose money from getting orders wrong.

This game was inspired by the Papa's Pizzaria games and has a similar, yet much more simplified UI.

Enjoy cooking!
